# pixerise

An easy to use 3D renderer in Python.

#### Features:
- Pixerise is written in pure Python using NumPy and Numba to boosting performance
- No dependency on rendering libraries like OpenGL or Vulkan
- No dependency on media libraries like Pygame or Pyglet
- Rendering is performed by writing pixel data into a buffer that can be displayed using any system or media library
- Examples are provided to show how to easily use the library and use Pygame to view the results

#### Who is this for?
- Anyone who wants to do 3D rendering on any microcontroller or device without a GPU
- Anyone who wants to extend it to create other 3D applications or libraries that does not require a GPU
- Anyone who wants an agnostic 3D renderer that can be used with any media library
- Anyone who wants to learn 3D rendering from scratch by reading the source code in pure Python

#### Who is this NOT for?
- Anyone who wants to do 3D rendering that takes advantage of GPU acceleration
- Anyone who needs a 3D engine with a full suite of tools to create video games
